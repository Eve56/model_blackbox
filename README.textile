This matlab package intends to work as a blackbox for parameter estimation and model simulation

Requirements:
* Matlab
* SBToolbox2 (modified)
* SBPD (modified)

It is divided by
* source : source files
* estimators : cgi scripts that estimate parameters
* simulators : cgi scripts that estimate parameters

To create a new model blackbox you need to:

#. create a SBTOOLBOX2 model (SBModel) and copy it the directory:
 source/models/

#. compile the model calling the compile_model.m function, ex:
 compile_model('models/baranyi')

#. copy the following files to the same directory and name it after the model, preserving the suffix (just to help organizing the files' function
 source/estimators/TEMPLATE_est.m
 source/simulators/TEMPLATE_sim.m

#. change the source code to reflect the name of the model by replacing all the occurences of Gompertz to "Yourmodel"
 IMPORTANT: the first letter must be Uppercase

#. in the simulators/Yourmodel_sim.m you must change the code to handle the model's parameters

#. add the makefile target following the existing templates

#. run
 make yourmodel_est yourmodel_sim clean

Done!
