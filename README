This matlab package intends to work as a blackbox for parameter estimation and model simulation

It is divided by
 - source : source files
 - estimators : cgi scripts that estimate parameters
 - simulators : cgi scripts that estimate parameters

To create a new model blackbox you need to:

1. create a SBTOOLBOX2 model (SBModel) and copy it the directory:
 source/models/

2. compile the model calling the compile_model.m function, ex:
 compile_model('models/baranyi')

3. copy the following files to the same directory and name it after the model, preserving the suffix (just to help organizing the files' function
 source/estimators/TEMPLATE_est.m
 source/simulators/TEMPLATE_sim.m

4. change the source code to reflect the name of the model by replacing all the occurences of Gompertz to "Yourmodel"
 IMPORTANT: the first letter must be Uppercase

5. in the simulators/Yourmodel_sim.m you must change the code to handle the model's parameters

Done!
